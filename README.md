Steps to run the application in your local machine.

1. Ensure you have node.js and npm installed in your machine. If not installed, visit node's download page (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and choose the version applicable for your operating system. This download when run would install both node and npm on your machine.
2. Confirm npm and node installation by running `npm -v` and `node -v` command in command prompt.
3. Clone/Download the application onto your local file-system from github link (https://github.com/Kateryars/HarmanAssessment).
4. Install npm packages by running command `npm install` from command prompt while inside the folder where code-files where cloned.
5. NPM packages would take close to 5-10 mins for installation. Please wait.
6. If you are behind a proxy, you might have to get your npm proxy config set-up done with the help of your system admin guys.
7. Once packages are installed, run `ng serve -o` to compile the code and start the dev server.
8. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` from a browser to view the application.
